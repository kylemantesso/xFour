# Welcome to your Convex + Vercel app

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project demonstrating how to use Convex with Vercel.

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting and deployment by integrating Convex through the Vercel Marketplace.
